        synopsis: "While the Nordic race of men are the predominant race in Skyrim, the region forms one province of the much larger Empire, ruled by the Imperials. The Empire has recently fought a war with the Aldmeri Dominion, a powerful confederation of elves, who believe that they are racially superior to the races of men, such as the Imperials and Nords. While the conflict, known as the Great War, ended in a military stalemate, the greatly weakened Empire was forced to sign a humiliating peace treaty called the White-Gold Concordat.<br><br>While most of Tamriel worship a religious pantheon consisting of eight deities, the Nords of Skyrim are accustomed to worship nine, believing that the Nordic general Tiber Septim, the founder of the Empire, ascended to godhood after his death, becoming the deity Talos. The Dominion, led by the intolerant Thalmor sect, rejects this notion, since it implies that a man became greater than any elf, and thus instituted a clause in the Concordat which forbade Talos worship in the Empire. This condition, which was received with great anger in Skyrim, was one of the principal reasons behind the rebellion of Ulfric Stormcloak, the Jarl of Windhelm, against the Empire's Imperial Legion; the game begins with the conflict between the Stormcloaks and Imperials finely poised.<br><br>The race of dragons has long been almost completely extinct - the survival of the last, the sage Paarthurnax, is known only to the Greybeard order of monks. Having ruled over vast swathes of Tamriel in the ancient past, their hegemony was overthrown by the \"Dragonborn\" warriors, humans who could absorb a dragon's soul and use the powerful draconic spells called \"shouts\". Three of the most powerful even managed to cast Alduin, the black dragon foretold to consume the world, into the currents of time using an Elder Scroll, a powerful and mystical artifact. The Dragonborn heritage persisted much later than the dragons themselves - Tiber Septim had been one - but the last had died during the events of Oblivion. However, ancient Nordic prophecy maintained that when Alduin at last re-emerged into the world, a \"Last Dragonborn\" would also appear to fight and defeat him.",
